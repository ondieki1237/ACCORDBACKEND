# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) - Engineering Services API

## Overview
The Engineering Services API implements strict role-based access control to separate Sales, Engineer, Admin, and Manager users with appropriate permissions.

---

## User Roles

### 1. **Admin**
- Full access to all operations
- Can create, read, update, delete any service
- Can view all statistics
- Can assign services to any engineer
- Can perform bulk operations

### 2. **Manager**
- Similar to Admin but cannot delete services
- Can create, read, update any service
- Can view all statistics
- Can assign services to any engineer
- Can perform bulk operations

### 3. **Engineer**
- **READ**: Only services assigned to them
- **UPDATE**: Only their assigned services, limited fields only:
  - `status` (pending → in-progress → completed)
  - `conditionBefore`
  - `conditionAfter`
  - `notes`
  - `otherPersonnel`
  - `nextServiceDate`
- **CANNOT**: Create services, assign services, delete services, view other engineers' services

### 4. **Sales**
- **READ**: Only services they created
- **CREATE**: Can request services (but cannot assign engineers)
- **CANNOT**: Update services, delete services, view other users' services

## API Endpoints & Permissions

### Public (All Authenticated Users)
```
GET /api/engineering-services/by-facility
- All authenticated users can search services by facility
- Results are filtered by role (engineers see only theirs, sales see only theirs created)
```

---

### Admin/Manager Only Endpoints

---

### Engineer-Only Endpoints

#### 1. Get My Assigned Services
```
GET /api/engineering-services/mine
Authorization: Bearer <engineer_token>
```
**Behavior**: Automatically filters by `engineerId = req.user._id`

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "docs": [
      {
        "_id": "service123",
        "facility": {
          "name": "City Hospital",
          "location": "Nairobi"
        },
        "serviceType": "maintenance",
        "status": "assigned",
        "scheduledDate": "2025-11-01T08:00:00Z",
        "machineDetails": "X-Ray Model 500",
        "engineerInCharge": {
          "_id": "eng123",
          "name": "John Doe"
        }
      }
    ],
    "totalDocs": 5,
    "page": 1
  }
}
```

#### 2. Get Services by Engineer ID (Own Only)
```
GET /api/engineering-services/by-engineer/:engineerId
Authorization: Bearer <engineer_token>
```
**Validation**: `engineerId` must match `req.user._id` (engineer can only view their own)

#### 3. Update Own Service (Limited Fields)
```
PUT /api/engineering-services/:id
Authorization: Bearer <engineer_token>

{
  "status": "in-progress",
  "conditionBefore": "Machine showing error E402",
  "notes": "Started diagnostics"
}
```

**Allowed Fields for Engineers**:
- ✅ `status`
- ✅ `conditionBefore`
- ✅ `conditionAfter`
- ✅ `notes`
- ✅ `otherPersonnel`
- ✅ `nextServiceDate`

**Forbidden Fields for Engineers**:
- ❌ `engineerInCharge`
- ❌ `facility`
- ❌ `serviceType`
- ❌ `machineDetails`
- ❌ `scheduledDate`
- ❌ `userId`

**Validation**:
1. Checks if service is assigned to the engineer
2. Returns 403 if engineer tries to update someone else's service
3. Filters out any forbidden fields from the request

---

### Sales Endpoints

#### 1. Get Services Created by Sales User
```
GET /api/engineering-services
Authorization: Bearer <sales_token>
```
**Behavior**: Automatically filters by `userId = req.user._id` (services they created)

#### 2. Get Specific Service (Own Only)
```
GET /api/engineering-services/:id
Authorization: Bearer <sales_token>
```
**Validation**: Service must have `userId === req.user._id`

## Engineer Workflow (Step by Step)

### 1. Login as Engineer
```bash
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "engineer@accord.com",
  "password": "password"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "accessToken": "eyJ...",
    "user": {
      "_id": "eng123",
      "role": "engineer",
      "firstName": "John",
      "lastName": "Doe"
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. View My Assigned Services
```bash
GET /api/engineering-services/mine
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### 3. View Service Details
```bash
GET /api/engineering-services/service123
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### 4. Start Service (Update Status)
```bash
PUT /api/engineering-services/service123
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "in-progress",
  "conditionBefore": "Machine displaying error code E402. Unable to start calibration.",
  "notes": "Started diagnostics at 8:30 AM"
}
```

### 5. Complete Service (Submit Report)
```bash
PUT /api/engineering-services/service123
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "status": "completed",
  "conditionBefore": "Machine displaying error code E402",
  "conditionAfter": "All systems operational. Error code cleared. Machine passed all tests.",
  "notes": "Replaced faulty sensor, recalibrated, updated firmware to v2.3.1",
  "nextServiceDate": "2026-02-01T08:00:00Z",
  "otherPersonnel": ["Hospital technician: Mary Wanjiru"]
}
```

## Security Features

### 1. **Token-Based Authentication**
- All endpoints require valid JWT token
- Token must contain user ID and role
- Expired tokens are rejected

### 2. **Role Validation**
- Each endpoint checks `req.user.role`
- Unauthorized roles receive 403 Forbidden
- Role checks happen before any database operations

### 3. **Ownership Validation**
- Engineers can only access services where `engineerInCharge._id === req.user._id`
- Sales can only access services where `userId === req.user._id`
- Admin/Manager bypass ownership checks

### 4. **Field-Level Access Control**
- Engineers have restricted update fields
- Forbidden fields are filtered out before update
- Attempts to update forbidden fields are silently ignored

### 5. **Query Filtering**
- User role automatically applies filters to queries
- Engineers: `engineerId = req.user._id`
- Sales: `userId = req.user._id`
- Prevents data leakage across roles

---

## Error Responses

### Unauthorized (401)
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Access token is required"
}
```

### Forbidden (403) - Wrong Role
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Access denied. Insufficient permissions."
}
```

### Forbidden (403) - Not Owner
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "You can only view services assigned to you"
}
```

### Not Found (404)
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Service not found"
}
```

---

## Testing Role Separation

### Test Case 1: Engineer Tries to View Another Engineer's Service
```bash
# Engineer A's token
GET /api/engineering-services/service_assigned_to_engineer_b
Authorization: Bearer <engineer_a_token>

# Expected: 403 Forbidden
```

### Test Case 2: Engineer Tries to Update Forbidden Field
```bash
PUT /api/engineering-services/service123
Authorization: Bearer <engineer_token>

{
  "engineerInCharge": {
    "_id": "different_engineer_id"  # Forbidden field
  },
  "notes": "My notes"  # Allowed field
}

# Expected: 200 OK
# Result: Only "notes" is updated, "engineerInCharge" is ignored
```

### Test Case 3: Sales User Tries to Create Service
```bash
POST /api/engineering-services
Authorization: Bearer <sales_token>

# Expected: 403 Forbidden (only admin/manager can create)
```

### Test Case 4: Manager Views All Services
```bash
GET /api/engineering-services
Authorization: Bearer <manager_token>

# Expected: 200 OK with all services (no filtering)
```

## Implementation Checklist

### Backend (✅ Complete)
- ✅ `authenticate` middleware validates JWT
- ✅ `authorize` middleware checks roles
- ✅ Role-based route protection
- ✅ Ownership validation for engineers
- ✅ Field-level access control
- ✅ Query filtering by role
- ✅ Error handling with appropriate status codes

### Frontend Integration Required
- [ ] Store user role in local storage after login
- [ ] Conditionally show/hide UI based on role
- [ ] Show "Engineer Dashboard" only for engineers
- [ ] Show "Admin Panel" only for admin/manager
- [ ] Handle 403 errors gracefully
- [ ] Display appropriate error messages

### Database
- ✅ User model has `role` field
- ✅ EngineeringService model has `engineerInCharge` and `userId`
- [ ] Create test users with different roles
- [ ] Seed test data with various service assignments

## Summary

✅ **Sales and Engineer roles are now completely separated**

- **Engineers** can only view and update services assigned to them with restricted fields
- **Sales** can only view services they created
- **Admin/Manager** have full access to all services
- All endpoints enforce role-based access control
- Ownership validation prevents cross-user data access
- Field-level restrictions prevent unauthorized modifications

The backend API is production-ready with proper role separation and security!
